## Workout structure
Workout is a list of exercises with weight(kgs) x reps.
Every exercise is 3 sets with 2-3 mins of rest unless specified otherwise.

Every point is followed by any alternative exercises I use sometimes.
The choice of exercises is explained in ../exercises.

Every workout starts with 5 mins of cardio (usually running).
