# Leg Day
Mostly legs, but I also try and fit in some obliques and/or spinal erectors.
TODO: Move one of those to push day, it has a slot. Start doing hip thrusts for those sweet cheeks.

### 1. Machine leg press (175 x 8)
**Description:**
Heavy hitter. More enjoyable than squats.
**Alts:**
Squats

### 2. Hyperextension
**Description:**
Spinal erectors. Deadlifts are cool but that tension is bad for my eyesight.
**Alts:**
Deadlifts

### 3. Hamstring curls (50 x 9)
**Description:**
Hamstrings.
**Alts:**
Stiff leg deadlift

### 4. Calf raises (18 x 12 each)
**Description:**
Calf isolation. Gonna go back to both legs until I max out the machine again.
**Alts:**
Other calf raises, I guess?

### 5. Machine leg extensions (40 x 10 each)
**Description:**
Same but for quads.
**Alts:**
Dumbbell lunges

### 6. Machine adductions/abductions
**Description:**
Some more isolation.
**Alts:**
unnecessary
